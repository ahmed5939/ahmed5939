## üëë AHMED: DESTROYER OF BUGS, CONQUEROR OF CODE

I don't always code, but when I do, **production servers tremble in fear**.

## üî• MY CODING JOURNEY: A TALE OF GLORY AND CAFFEINE

- **2019**: Wrote my first "Hello World" program. The world was never the same.
- **2020**: Learned JavaScript. Electrons in processors literally begged for mercy.
- **2021**: Mastered React. Facebook offered to sell me their company. I politely declined.
- **2022**: Started using Next.js. Time travel was accidentally invented.
- **2023**: Touched GO. The entire Google engineering team sent me a handwritten thank you note.
- **NOW**: Building a School ERP System that will probably achieve sentience and enroll itself in college.

## üíª MY RELATIONSHIP WITH PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES

```javascript
// The secret code that powers my existence
function ahmed() {
  let mood = caffeine > 3 ? "UNSTOPPABLE" : "Still pretty awesome";
  
  if (dateTime.isMonday()) {
    return "Even my bugs have bugs today";
  }
  
  try {
    solveAllWorldProblems();
  } catch (error) {
    return "Will fix after lunch";
  }
  
  return "It works on my machine! ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø";
}
```

## üèÜ MY ACHIEVEMENTS

- **Made a printer work on the first try** (Still under FBI investigation for possible witchcraft)
- **Fixed a bug by turning it off and on again** (Now known as the "Ahmed Maneuver" in 17 countries)
- **Successfully explained what I do for a living to my grandma** (She still thinks I fix computers)
- **Wrote code so clean** that it was mistaken for a minimalist art installation
- **Found a use for jQuery** in 2023 (Currently in witness protection)

## üí≠ THOUGHTS THAT KEEP ME UP AT NIGHT

- Why is it called a "bug" and not a "code surprise"?
- Is a hotdog a sandwich? Is cereal a soup?
- If I create a program that makes programming languages, am I a grandparent when someone codes with it?
- Why do we park in driveways and drive on parkways?
- When I delete a line of code and everything works better, am I a coding genius or the problem?

## üì¨ WANT TO JOIN MY CODING ADVENTURES?

**WARNING**: Side effects of collaborating with me may include: spontaneous laughter, excessive caffeine consumption, using "Have you tried turning it off and on again?" unironically, and the ability to talk to rubber ducks.
